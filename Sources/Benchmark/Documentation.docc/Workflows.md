# Workflows

Benchmark supports local workflow patterns as well as CI integration to enforce benchmark performance.

## Overview

While developing locally, you can set benchmark baselines, compare against a baseline, or compare two different baselines.

### Local developer workflow

Typical workflow for a developer who wants to track performance metrics on the local machine while during performance work, would be to store one or more baselines (either default or named baselines), with e.g:

```
swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory benchmark baseline update
```

or

```
swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory benchmark baseline alpha update
```

then while working, simply compare current state of local repo with the previously recorded baseline:

```
swift package benchmark baseline compare
```

or

```
swift package benchmark compare alpha
```

If you have stored multiple baselines (for example for different approaches to solving a given performance issue), you can easily compare the two approaches by using named baselines for each and then compare them:

```
swift package benchmark compare alpha beta
```

#### Debugging crashing benchmarks

The benchmark executables are set up to automatically run all tests when run standalone with simple debug output - this is to enable workflows where the benchmark is run in the Xcode debugger or with Instruments if desired - or with `lldb` on the command line on Linux to support debugging in problematic performance tests.

### GitHub CI workflow

For GitHub, there are sample workflows provided: 

* Delta comparison workflow, which will run the benchmark on both the pull request and the `main` branch and compare the results with the specified thresholds and fail/succeed the workflow accordingly. It also makes a comment into the PR with the results (which will be updated with subsequent runs of the workflow for the PR)
* Simple benchmark - simply runs the benchmark test suite on the pull request and update a separate PR commend with a link to the results.

For reproducible and good comparable results, it is *highly* recommended to set up a private GitHub runner that is
dedicated to performance benchmark runs.
