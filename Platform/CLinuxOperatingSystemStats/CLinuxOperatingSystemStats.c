 Man page documentation:
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 /proc/[pid]/io (since kernel 2.6.20)
 This file contains I/O statistics for the process, for
 example:

 # cat /proc/3828/io
 rchar: 323934931
 wchar: 323929600
 syscr: 632687
 syscw: 632675
 read_bytes: 0
 write_bytes: 323932160
 cancelled_write_bytes: 0

 The fields are as follows:

 rchar: characters read
 The number of bytes which this task has caused to
 be read from storage.  This is simply the sum of
 bytes which this process passed to read(2) and
 similar system calls.  It includes things such as
 terminal I/O and is unaffected by whether or not
 actual physical disk I/O was required (the read
 might have been satisfied from pagecache).

 wchar: characters written
 The number of bytes which this task has caused, or
 shall cause to be written to disk.  Similar caveats
 apply here as with rchar.

 syscr: read syscalls
 Attempt to count the number of read I/O operations—
 that is, system calls such as read(2) and pread(2).

 syscw: write syscalls
 Attempt to count the number of write I/O
 operations—that is, system calls such as write(2)
 and pwrite(2).

 read_bytes: bytes read
 Attempt to count the number of bytes which this
 process really did cause to be fetched from the
 storage layer.  This is accurate for block-backed
 filesystems.

 write_bytes: bytes written
 Attempt to count the number of bytes which this
 process caused to be sent to the storage layer.

 cancelled_write_bytes:
 The big inaccuracy here is truncate.  If a process
 writes 1 MB to a file and then deletes the file, it
 will in fact perform no writeout.  But it will have
 been accounted as having caused 1 MB of write.  In
 other words: this field represents the number of
 bytes which this process caused to not happen, by
 truncating pagecache.  A task can cause "negative"
 I/O too.  If this task truncates some dirty
 pagecache, some I/O which another task has been
 accounted for (in its write_bytes) will not be
 happening.

 Note: In the current implementation, things are a bit racy
 on 32-bit systems: if process A reads process B's
 /proc/[pid]/io while process B is updating one of these
 64-bit counters, process A could see an intermediate
 result.

 Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace
 access mode PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS check; see ptrace(2).


 -------------------------------------------------------------


 /proc/[pid]/stat
 Status information about the process.  This is used by
 ps(1).  It is defined in the kernel source file
 fs/proc/array.c.

 The fields, in order, with their proper scanf(3) format
 specifiers, are listed below.  Whether or not certain of
 these fields display valid information is governed by a
 ptrace access mode PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS |
 PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT check (refer to ptrace(2)).  If the
 check denies access, then the field value is displayed as
 0.  The affected fields are indicated with the marking
 [PT].

 (1) pid  %d
 The process ID.

 (2) comm  %s
 The filename of the executable, in parentheses.
 Strings longer than TASK_COMM_LEN (16) characters
 (including the terminating null byte) are silently
 truncated.  This is visible whether or not the
 executable is swapped out.

 (3) state  %c
 One of the following characters, indicating process
 state:

 R  Running

 S  Sleeping in an interruptible wait

 D  Waiting in uninterruptible disk sleep

 Z  Zombie

 T  Stopped (on a signal) or (before Linux 2.6.33)
 trace stopped

 t  Tracing stop (Linux 2.6.33 onward)

 W  Paging (only before Linux 2.6.0)

 X  Dead (from Linux 2.6.0 onward)

 x  Dead (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)

 K  Wakekill (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)

 W  Waking (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)

 P  Parked (Linux 3.9 to 3.13 only)

 (4) ppid  %d
 The PID of the parent of this process.

 (5) pgrp  %d
 The process group ID of the process.

 (6) session  %d
 The session ID of the process.

 (7) tty_nr  %d
 The controlling terminal of the process.  (The
 minor device number is contained in the combination
 of bits 31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device
 number is in bits 15 to 8.)

 (8) tpgid  %d
 The ID of the foreground process group of the
 controlling terminal of the process.

 (9) flags  %u
 The kernel flags word of the process.  For bit
 meanings, see the PF_* defines in the Linux kernel
 source file include/linux/sched.h.  Details depend
 on the kernel version.

 The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

 (10) minflt  %lu
 The number of minor faults the process has made
 which have not required loading a memory page from
 disk.

 (11) cminflt  %lu
 The number of minor faults that the process's
 waited-for children have made.

 (12) majflt  %lu
 The number of major faults the process has made
 which have required loading a memory page from
 disk.

 (13) cmajflt  %lu
 The number of major faults that the process's
 waited-for children have made.

 (14) utime  %lu
 Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
 in user mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
 sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).  This includes guest time,
 guest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU, see
 below), so that applications that are not aware of
 the guest time field do not lose that time from
 their calculations.

 (15) stime  %lu
 Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
 in kernel mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
 sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

 (16) cutime  %ld
 Amount of time that this process's waited-for
 children have been scheduled in user mode, measured
 in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).
 (See also times(2).)  This includes guest time,
 cguest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU, see
 below).

 (17) cstime  %ld
 Amount of time that this process's waited-for
 children have been scheduled in kernel mode,
 measured in clock ticks (divide by
 sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

 (18) priority  %ld
 (Explanation for Linux 2.6) For processes running a
 real-time scheduling policy (policy below; see
 sched_setscheduler(2)), this is the negated
 scheduling priority, minus one; that is, a number
 in the range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time
 priorities 1 to 99.  For processes running under a
 non-real-time scheduling policy, this is the raw
 nice value (setpriority(2)) as represented in the
 kernel.  The kernel stores nice values as numbers
 in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to
 the user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.

 Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on
 the scheduler weighting given to this process.

 (19) nice  %ld
 The nice value (see setpriority(2)), a value in the
 range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority).

 (20) num_threads  %ld
 Number of threads in this process (since Linux
 2.6).  Before kernel 2.6, this field was hard coded
 to 0 as a placeholder for an earlier removed field.

 (21) itrealvalue  %ld
 The time in jiffies before the next SIGALRM is sent
 to the process due to an interval timer.  Since
 kernel 2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained,
 and is hard coded as 0.

 (22) starttime  %llu
 The time the process started after system boot.  In
 kernels before Linux 2.6, this value was expressed
 in jiffies.  Since Linux 2.6, the value is
 expressed in clock ticks (divide by
 sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

 The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

 (23) vsize  %lu
 Virtual memory size in bytes.

 (24) rss  %ld
 Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has
 in real memory.  This is just the pages which count
 toward text, data, or stack space.  This does not
 include pages which have not been demand-loaded in,
 or which are swapped out.  This value is
 inaccurate; see /proc/[pid]/statm below.

 (25) rsslim  %lu
 Current soft limit in bytes on the rss of the
 process; see the description of RLIMIT_RSS in
 getrlimit(2).

 (26) startcode  %lu  [PT]
 The address above which program text can run.

 (27) endcode  %lu  [PT]
 The address below which program text can run.

 (28) startstack  %lu  [PT]
 The address of the start (i.e., bottom) of the
 stack.

 (29) kstkesp  %lu  [PT]
 The current value of ESP (stack pointer), as found
 in the kernel stack page for the process.

 (30) kstkeip  %lu  [PT]
 The current EIP (instruction pointer).

 (31) signal  %lu
 The bitmap of pending signals, displayed as a
 decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
 provide information on real-time signals; use
 /proc/[pid]/status instead.

 (32) blocked  %lu
 The bitmap of blocked signals, displayed as a
 decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
 provide information on real-time signals; use
 /proc/[pid]/status instead.

 (33) sigignore  %lu
 The bitmap of ignored signals, displayed as a
 decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
 provide information on real-time signals; use
 /proc/[pid]/status instead.

 (34) sigcatch  %lu
 The bitmap of caught signals, displayed as a
 decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
 provide information on real-time signals; use
 /proc/[pid]/status instead.

 (35) wchan  %lu  [PT]
 This is the "channel" in which the process is
 waiting.  It is the address of a location in the
 kernel where the process is sleeping.  The
 corresponding symbolic name can be found in
 /proc/[pid]/wchan.

 (36) nswap  %lu
 Number of pages swapped (not maintained).

 (37) cnswap  %lu
 Cumulative nswap for child processes (not
 maintained).

 (38) exit_signal  %d  (since Linux 2.1.22)
 Signal to be sent to parent when we die.

 (39) processor  %d  (since Linux 2.2.8)
 CPU number last executed on.

 (40) rt_priority  %u  (since Linux 2.5.19)
 Real-time scheduling priority, a number in the
 range 1 to 99 for processes scheduled under a real-
 time policy, or 0, for non-real-time processes (see
 sched_setscheduler(2)).

 (41) policy  %u  (since Linux 2.5.19)
 Scheduling policy (see sched_setscheduler(2)).
 Decode using the SCHED_* constants in
 linux/sched.h.

 The format for this field was %lu before Linux
 2.6.22.

 (42) delayacct_blkio_ticks  %llu  (since Linux 2.6.18)
 Aggregated block I/O delays, measured in clock
 ticks (centiseconds).

 (43) guest_time  %lu  (since Linux 2.6.24)
 Guest time of the process (time spent running a
 virtual CPU for a guest operating system), measured
 in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

 (44) cguest_time  %ld  (since Linux 2.6.24)
 Guest time of the process's children, measured in
 clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

 Address above which program initialized and
 uninitialized (BSS) data are placed.

 (46) end_data  %lu  (since Linux 3.3)  [PT]
 Address below which program initialized and
 uninitialized (BSS) data are placed.

 (47) start_brk  %lu  (since Linux 3.3)  [PT]
